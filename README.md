# Fortify SSC Parser Plugin for Clair / Yair

## Introduction

This Fortify SSC parser plugin allows for importing scan results from Clair (Vulnerability Static Analysis for Containers).

Clair itself doesn't provide any file-based reports; as such this parser plugin parses reports generated
by the Yair command line interface for Clair. See the [Obtain results](#obtain-results) section for more information.

## Plugin Installation

These sections describe how to install, upgrade and uninstall the plugin.

### Install & Upgrade

* Obtain the plugin binary jar file
	* Either download from Bintray (see [Related Links](#related-links)) 
	* Or by building yourself (see [Developers](#developers))
* If you already have another version of the plugin installed, first uninstall the previously 
 installed version of the plugin by following the steps under [Uninstall](#uninstall) below
* In Fortify Software Security Center:
	* Navigate to Administration->Plugins->Parsers
	* Click the `NEW` button
	* Accept the warning
	* Upload the plugin jar file
	* Enable the plugin by clicking the `ENABLE` button
  
### Uninstall

* In Fortify Software Security Center:
	* Navigate to Administration->Plugins->Parsers
	* Select the parser plugin that you want to uninstall
	* Click the `DISABLE` button
	* Click the `REMOVE` button 


## Obtain results

Please see the Yair documentation for detailed usage instructions. Note that the SSC parser plugin for Yair 
expects a JSON file as input, so Yair will need to be configured to generate reports in JSON format.

As an example, the following Linux/bash commands were used to generate the 
[src/test/resources/node_10.14.2-jessie.yair.json](src/test/resources/node_10.14.2-jessie.yair.json) 
file:

```bash
# Generate Yair configuration file
cat <<'EOF' > $PWD/yair.config
---
registry:
  host: "registry.hub.docker.com"

clair:
  host: "clair:6060"

output:
  format: json

fail_on:
  score: 0
  big_vulnerability: false
EOF

# Analyze the node:10.14.2-jessie image and save results in JSON file
docker run -v $PWD/yair.config:/opt/yair/config/config.yaml:ro --link clair:clair yfoelling/yair node:10.14.2-jessie > node_10.14.2-jessie.yair.json
```

The example above assumes that you want to scan images from the Docker Hub registry, and that Clair is running inside
another Docker container named `clair`. For completeness, the following Linux/bash commands were used to set up
such a Clair container for testing and demonstration purposes:

```bash
# Start Postgres DB without superuser password (for testing only)
docker run -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust --name postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

# Check Postgres started OK
docker logs postgres

# Create and navigate into clair directory
mkdir clair
cd clair

# Get sample config, save as clair.config
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/clair/master/config.yaml.sample -o $PWD/clair.config

# Update config file to use postgres docker container
sed -i 's/source: host=localhost/source: host=postgres/g' $PWD/clair.config

# Run clair as dameon
docker run --name clair --link postgres:postgres -p 6060:6060 -p 6061:6061 -v $PWD/clair.config:/config/config.yaml -d quay.io/coreos/clair:latest -config=/config/config.yaml

# Check Clair started OK
docker logs clair
```


## Upload results

As a 3<sup>rd</sup>-party results zip bundle:

* Generate a scan.info file containing a single line as follows:  
`engineType=CLAIR_YAIR`
* Generate a zip file containing the following:
	* The scan.info file generated in the previous step
	* The JSON file containing scan results
* Upload the zip file generated in the previous step to SSC
	* Using any SSC client, for example FortifyClient or Maven plugin
	* Or using the SSC web interface
	* Similar to how you would upload an FPR file

As raw scan results:  

* Navigate to the Artifacts tab of your application version
* Click the `UPLOAD` button
* Click the `ADD FILES` button, and select the JSON file to upload
* Enable the `3rd party results` check box
* Select the `CLAIR_YAIR` type

*Note that uploading raw scan results is only supported for manual uploads through the SSC web interface, and this functionality was removed in SSC 20.2 so no longer available in recent SSC versions. Please submit a feature request if you'd like to see this easier process for ad-hoc uploading of 3<sup>rd</sup>-party results restored, referencing Octane id #448174.*


## Developers

The following sections provide information that may be useful for developers of this utility.

### IDE's

This project uses Lombok. In order to have your IDE compile this project without errors, 
you may need to add Lombok support to your IDE. Please see https://projectlombok.org/setup/overview 
for more information.

### Gradle Wrapper

It is strongly recommended to build this project using the included Gradle Wrapper
scripts; using other Gradle versions may result in build errors and other issues.

The Gradle build uses various helper scripts from https://github.com/fortify-ps/gradle-helpers;
please refer to the documentation and comments in included scripts for more information. 

### Common Commands

All commands listed below use Linux/bash notation; adjust accordingly if you
are running on a different platform. All commands are to be executed from
the main project directory.

* `./gradlew tasks --all`: List all available tasks
* Build: (plugin binary will be stored in `build/libs`)
	* `./gradlew clean build`: Clean and build the project
	* `./gradlew build`: Build the project without cleaning
	* `./gradlew dist distThirdParty`: Build distribution zip and third-party information bundle
* `./fortify-scan.sh`: Run a Fortify scan; requires Fortify SCA to be installed

### Automated Builds

This project uses GitHub Actions workflows to perform automated builds for both development and production releases. All pushes to the main branch qualify for building a production release. Commits on the main branch should use [Conventional Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/); it is recommended to also use conventional commit messages on any other branches.

User-facing commits (features or fixes) on the main branch will trigger the [release-please-action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action) to automatically create a pull request for publishing a release version. This pull request contains an automatically generated CHANGELOG.md together with a version.txt based on the conventional commit messages on the main branch. Merging such a pull request will automatically publish the production binaries and Docker images to the locations described in the [Related Links](#related-links) section.

Every push to a branch in the GitHub repository will also automatically trigger a development release to be built. By default, development releases are only published as build job artifacts. However, if a tag named `dev_<branch-name>` exists, then development releases are also published to the locations described in the [Related Links](#related-links) section. The `dev_<branch-name>` tag will be automatically updated to the commit that triggered the build.
