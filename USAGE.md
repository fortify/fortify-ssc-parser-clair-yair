# Fortify SSC Parser Plugin for Clair (Yair client) - Usage

## Introduction

This Fortify SSC parser plugin allows for importing scan results from Clair (Vulnerability Static Analysis for Containers).

Clair itself doesn't provide any file-based reports; as such this parser plugin parses reports generated by the Yair command line interface for Clair.

## Plugin Installation

These sections describe how to install, upgrade and uninstall the parser plugin in SSC.

### Install & Upgrade

* Obtain the plugin binary jar file; either:
     * Download from the repository release page: https://github.com/fortify/fortify-ssc-parser-clair-yair/releases
     * Build the plugin from source: https://github.com/fortify/fortify-ssc-parser-clair-yair/CONTRIB.md
* If you already have another version of the plugin installed, first uninstall the previously  installed version of the plugin by following the steps under [Uninstall](#uninstall) below
* In Fortify Software Security Center:
	* Navigate to Administration->Plugins->Parsers
	* Click the `NEW` button
	* Accept the warning
	* Upload the plugin jar file
	* Enable the plugin by clicking the `ENABLE` button
  
### Uninstall

* In Fortify Software Security Center:
     * Navigate to Administration->Plugins->Parsers
     * Select the parser plugin that you want to uninstall
     * Click the `DISABLE` button
     * Click the `REMOVE` button 

## Obtain results


<!-- START-INCLUDE:parser-obtain-results.md -->

Please see the Yair documentation for detailed usage instructions. Note that the SSC parser plugin for Yair 
expects a JSON file as input, so Yair will need to be configured to generate reports in JSON format.

As an example, the following Linux/bash commands were used to generate the 
[src/test/resources/node_10.14.2-jessie.yair.json](src/test/resources/node_10.14.2-jessie.yair.json) 
file:

```bash
# Generate Yair configuration file
cat <<'EOF' > $PWD/yair.config
---
registry:
  host: "registry.hub.docker.com"

clair:
  host: "clair:6060"

output:
  format: json

fail_on:
  score: 0
  big_vulnerability: false
EOF

# Analyze the node:10.14.2-jessie image and save results in JSON file
docker run -v $PWD/yair.config:/opt/yair/config/config.yaml:ro --link clair:clair yfoelling/yair node:10.14.2-jessie > node_10.14.2-jessie.yair.json
```

The example above assumes that you want to scan images from the Docker Hub registry, and that Clair is running inside
another Docker container named `clair`. For completeness, the following Linux/bash commands were used to set up
such a Clair container for testing and demonstration purposes:

```bash
# Start Postgres DB without superuser password (for testing only)
docker run -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust --name postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

# Check Postgres started OK
docker logs postgres

# Create and navigate into clair directory
mkdir clair
cd clair

# Get sample config, save as clair.config
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/clair/master/config.yaml.sample -o $PWD/clair.config

# Update config file to use postgres docker container
sed -i 's/source: host=localhost/source: host=postgres/g' $PWD/clair.config

# Run clair as dameon
docker run --name clair --link postgres:postgres -p 6060:6060 -p 6061:6061 -v $PWD/clair.config:/config/config.yaml -d quay.io/coreos/clair:latest -config=/config/config.yaml

# Check Clair started OK
docker logs clair
```

## Upload results

Results can be uploaded through the SSC web interface, REST API, or SSC client utilities like FortifyClient or [fcli](https://github.com/fortify-ps/fcli). The SSC web interface, FortifyClient and most other Fortify clients require the raw results to be packaged into a zip-file; REST API and fcli allow for uploading raw results directly.

To upload results through the SSC web interface or most clients:

* Create a `scan.info` file containing a single line as follows:   
     `engineType=CLAIR_YAIR`
* Create a zip file containing the following:
	* The scan.info file generated in the previous step
	* The raw results file as obtained from the target system (see [Obtain results](#obtain-results) section above)
* Upload the zip file generated in the previous step to SSC
	* Using any SSC client, for example FortifyClient or Maven plugin
	* Or using the SSC web interface
	* Similar to how you would upload an FPR file
	
Both SSC REST API and fcli provide options for specifying the engine type directly, and as such it is not necessary to package the raw results into a zip-file with accompanying `scan.info` file. For example, fcli allows for uploading raw scan results using a command like the following:

`fcli ssc appversion-artifact upload <raw-results-file> --appversion MyApp:MyVersion --engine-type CLAIR_YAIR`
